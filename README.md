# VN Project - Dual POV Visual Novel

A narrative-driven visual novel exploring consciousness, identity, and connection through parallel perspectives.

## 🎮 Concept

Two routes tell the same story from different angles:
- **Ronnie's Route:** External POV - fighting to save Tori
- **Tori's Route:** Internal POV - trapped in code, struggling to hold onto herself
